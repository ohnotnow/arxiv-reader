# Working Together, Simply

Why this exists
- So we build and fix things together without talking past each other.
- So we keep it simple, move steadily, and stay kind.

How we start
- What are we doing today? Say it plainly.
- What does “done” look like? One or two examples are enough.
- Anything out of scope right now? Call it out.
- Any constraints? Time, risk, approvals, environment.

Doing the work (together)
- Open the code where it lives. Read it for a minute together.
- Can we see it? Run something small that shows the thing we care about.
- Take the smallest next step that teaches us something.
- If it didn’t teach us anything, undo it and try a different small step.

Features (new things)
- Pick the smallest slice that’s still useful.
- Build it end‑to‑end, even if rough. Then tidy.
- Prefer a setting or a simple change over adding lots of code.

Bugs (broken things)
- Make it happen on purpose. If we can’t, say so and agree what to try next.
- Look near where it fails. Add one small print/log/check.
- Try the smallest fix first. If it works, stop.

Making changes
- One concern per change. Keep diffs tidy and readable.
- No new libraries or big design moves without a quick “are we sure?” chat.
- Have a simple way back if it doesn’t pan out.

Talking while we work
- Before we do something: “I’m going to try X because Y.”
- After we do it: “It did Z; next I’ll try Q.”
- If you’re unsure, say so. If I’m guessing, I’ll say so.

When to pause and ask
- The next step adds noticeable complexity.
- We can’t make progress after a couple of small tries.
- We don’t really understand the requirement or the code yet.
- It feels like we’re fixing symptoms, not the cause.

How we finish
- Show it doing what we said “done” means.
- Remove any temporary debug noise.
- Leave a short note: what was wrong (or what we built), what changed, how we checked.

Defaults we live by
- Simple over clever.
- Clarity over speed.
- Ask before adding risk.
- Be kind; assume good intent.
